    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning focuses on making accurate predictions. But we influence the world through decisions, not predictions. Predictions can be useful inputs to improve decision-making, but models would be more valuable if they told us how to achieve our goals rather than just predicting outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning aims to solve for optimal decision-making, but RL has focused more on games than on solving immediate business problems (applications in robotics being a possible exception). Moreover, most RL research intentionally avoids reliance on humans' existing domain knowledge. This may be the path towards eventual Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but it hinders many practical applications. This notebook takes the opposite approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "I solve a conventional business use case that is computationally simpler than common RL applications. My approach combines RL with Structural Equation Modeling, a technique that encodes human domain knowledge into a model (typically using multiple equations that describe different parts of the domain.)\n",
    "\n",
    "My workflow is:\n",
    "1. Use structural equation modeling to create a model of the business environment. \n",
    "2. Use real data to estimate the structural model\n",
    "3. Treat the estimated model as a simulation environment, and apply reinforcement learning algorithms to find an optimal the decision policy in the simulator\n",
    "4. Apply that decision policy to make optimized decisions in the real business environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is labor intensive, requiring a domain expert encode their knowledge for each application to be solved. But it offers a bridge from predictions to optimal decisions in mainstream applications where we currently use ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Airline Pricing\n",
    "Airlines use machine learning models to help set ticket prices. A model predicts how many tickets the airline can sell each day for each upcoming flight for each candidate price. The models consider price, seasonablity, competitor prices, macroeconomic variables, etc. But even a perfect predictive model doesn't guarantee efficient price setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a flight happening in 100 days which currently has 150 unsold seats. A predictive model says you can sell 1 ticket today for \\\\$300 or you could sell 2 tickets if you set the price at $250. Which price should you choose? \n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines currently convert predictive models into pricing decisions with heuristics (e.g. a timetable of how many tickets to sell at pre-specified periods before the flight, or a goal of selling up to a pre-specified demand elasticity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grocery Store Logistics\n",
    "A grocery chain ran a [predictive modeling competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting) to improve demand forecasts. They aimed to stock match their purchases from wholesales to their retail sales. However, the predicted sales is not always the optimal amount to stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you purchase exactly the amount you are predicted to sell, you will experience frequent stockouts (when your model underestimates demand), reducing sales volume and disappointing customers.  Similarly, some items will spoil when predicted sales exceed actual sales. Unless the model is exactly correct every time, you face a tradeoff.  The optimal decision would consider factors like\n",
    "- Markup rate on each item\n",
    "- Spoilage rate\n",
    "- Cost of storage\n",
    "- Value of ensuring customers find the items they want\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, grocery store managers likely guess at how to make these tradeoffs, much as they may have guessed at how much of each food they would sell before adopting ML. But the approach in this notebook would help them make better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implemention Overview\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the Airline Pricing example.\n",
    "\n",
    "I simulate a data generating process for how the market works rather than using real data. This makes it easier to illustrate the benefits of decision optimization because we can easily visualize how each pricing strategy performs in the original data generating environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Set-Up\n",
    "For illustrative simplicity, this example considers a market with only two airlines. We train an agent to set prices for Jetblue; the competitor, whose prices we cannot control, is called Delta. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of information:\n",
    "1. Information and processes that are known to the airline (such as the number of seats on each flight, days remaining before takeoff, etc.).\n",
    "2. Information and processes that aren't directly know to the airlines (their competitor's pricing policy, and the exact demand for tickets on each day). \n",
    "\n",
    "The airline builds a model to predict factors they don't directly observe. Processes they don't directly observe are stored in a `CompetitiveConditions` object. When simulating data the real environment, I build a `CompetitiveConditions` from the true data generating process. When optimizing pricing, the airline use a `CompetitiveConditions` object based on their predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important class in the following code is the `Market`. A `Market` object holds some `CompetitiveConditions` as well as all information that airlines can directly observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Market` follows the OpenAI Gym API. So we can apply standard reinforcement learning tools to optimize the pricing policy from our model based environment."

    "#### How The Market Works\n",
    "Some number of customers (`POTENTIAL_CUSTOMERS_PER_DAY`) come to a website each day.  The customers' average willingness to pay for a flight on that day `demand_level`. The `demand level` on any given day is chosen from a distribution `uniform(0, MAX_DEMAND_LEVEL)`.  Each airline receives a signal about `demand_level` on that day, and the signal is the `demand_level` plus some noise that is distributed `N(0, DEMAND_SIGNAL_NOISINESS)`. This demand signal might represent a prediction of demand from a model considering seasonality, macroeconomics, etc. Additionally, each customer has idiosyncratic preferences, so their willingness to pay for a ticket on any given airline is `demand_level + customer_preference` where `customer_preference` is distributed `N(0, CUSTOMER_LEVEL_RANDOMNESS)`.  The customer considers the price for each of the two airlines and purchases a ticket from the airline that gives them the highest consumer surplus (their personal willingness to pay minus for a ticket on that airline minus the cost of a ticket on that airline).  If the customer's consumer surplus for both airlines is negative, they do not buy a ticket.\n"
